# TNR Cat Game

### Reason and Motivation

##### My reasoning behind making this game was to spread the word on the dangers of not steralizing stray cats and how TNR (Trap Neuter and Release) can offer a solution to the ever growing number of stray and feral cats out there.

##### Even among the pet community, TNR can be controversial. Some people see it as cruel, as the cats have the tip of their ear cut off to mark they have been through the program, while others see it as pointless. Others don't even see a need for it.

##### I wanted to make a game that highlights the risks of a cat having kittens over and over without any sort of vaccination. People get really invested in games, especially when they can customize their characters. So I wanted to make a game where you can customize your cat and then have to protect your babies.


### Inputs and outputs

##### When it comes to inputs and outputs, most of the inputs go into controlling the mother cat. You can control her going up and down and side to side.

##### All the sprites in the game have a bounding box activated. The enemy and mice sprites cannot overlap each other thanks to their displace function they have.

##### The mother cat sprite can sense when it is overlapping all of the other sprites coming towards her, which will then allow for all the additional effects that can come with hitting enemies and hitting mice.

##### As of right now, the code to speed up when you hit the mice is there but not fully functional. The same can be said with the code to loose one of your lives (aka one of the kittens) when you hit a sprite you're supposed to dodge.


### Target audience

##### My target audience is someone who is around my age, late teens to early twenties, though it can target people who are a lot older and a lot younger. I want to target people who can actively support TNR or can go out and do it themselves.

##### Since games are universal, I can see it being used to educate people a lot younger as well.


### Display

##### I would want to host the game on the site of groups that focus on TNRing cats. I would also want to host it on the Miami Dade Animal service website, since Miami Dade has, in recent years, been focusing on their TNR program.
