# Yeti World

### Reason and Motivation

##### The goal of my midterm was to create an interactive, aesthetically pleasing world. I wanted to go with a simplistic design, with round edges and few contrasting sharp edges.

### Inputs and Outputs

##### I have several inputs and hit zones. The first hit zone is the Yeti's body, which when pressed makes him blink. It also results in the changing instruction texts.

##### The following input is the ham, which can be pressed and carried throughout the screen. Clicking on the ham results in a change in his eyes and his mouth. Releasing makes his mouth disappear and eyes return to normal. His mouth is another hit zone. When the ham is pressed and taken to his mouth, it will disappear and turn into a bone.

##### As soon as the ham is eaten, it triggers snow to fall. When the snow falls, it triggers a moving animation that makes him tremble. His eyes also get bags underneath to emphasize him being cold.

##### The hat hit zone is then activated once the snow starts falling, as well as the instructions changing. The hat can then be picked up and carried to his head. The Yeti's body is still a hit zone. When you reach the body while carrying the hat, the hat will snap in place to the top of the Yeti's head.

##### Doing so changes the instructions once more and his eyes become half closed. The sun is a hit zone that when pressed makes it nighttime. Doing so will also put the final instruction up. With the hat on and it being nighttime, his eyes will close and 'Z's will float up into the sky.

##### The moon also acts as a hit zone. You can switch between daytime and nighttime by clicking on the sun and the moon.

### Target Audience

##### My target audience would be someone younger, probably in grade to early middle school. Because of the cartoonish design and simple premise, I think it would be more suited for someone in that age group.

##### I think if I added more complexity and more input and outputs, it could be for an older audience. I would have to have more of the inputs and outputs overlap to make interacting with the world more dynamic.

### Display

##### I think for display, my project is better suited for a computer screen. The dimensions, unless flipped on a phone, don't seem well suited for a smaller screen.
